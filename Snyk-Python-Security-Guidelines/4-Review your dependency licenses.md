# Review your dependency licenses

When considering using an open source project, it is important to understand how these projects are licensed. Open source projects are free and available to use, but there may still be terms and conditions applied. These terms usually involve how the software is used, whether you need to make any changes you make to the software publicly available, and other similar requirements. You should become familiar with the [open source licenses](https://snyk.io/learn/open-source-licenses/) necessary for the projects you use, so you are sure that you are not compromising yourself legally.

If the project adopts a [more restrictive license](https://snyk.io/learn/what-is-copyleft-license/) than you anticipated ([GPL](https://snyk.io/learn/what-is-gpl-license-gplv3-explained/), SSPL, etc.), you can end up cornering yourself, leaving you to either comply with the terms of the license or cease using the project. Additionally, if you need to make changes to a project that does not have a license, you might run afoul with copyright law.

To ensure that your project is sustainable and you do not expose yourself to unnecessary Python security and legal risks, scan and fix license and vulnerability issues in your projectâ€™s dependencies.
