# Scan your code

Developers have a wide array of static code analysis tools at their disposal for maintaining Python security. Let’s take a look at three different levels of tools. 

First, the **linter** level. [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) has been serving for decades now as a style guide for Python. Various tools are available (and built into IDEs) to check against this style guide, like [pep8](https://pypi.org/project/pep8/), [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/), [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/#), and more. 

Next, tools like [bandit](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/) transform code into an abstract syntax tree (AST) and perform queries on it to find typical [security issues](https://snyk.io/learn/security-vulnerability-exploits-threats/). This is a level above what typical linters do, which work on a syntactical level. Still, bandit is limited by its intermediate representation and performance. For example, bandit cannot detect data flow related issues (known as taint-analysis) and these result in devastating flaws (injections like SQL injection or XSS as an example). 

Finally, [Static Application Security Testing (SAST)](https://snyk.io/learn/application-security/static-application-security-testing/) tools like [Snyk Code](https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/) run a semantic analysis, taking even complex interfile issues into account. Unlike other tools on this level, Snyk Code is developer-friendly by scanning fast and [integrating into the IDE](https://snyk.io/ide-plugins) (or your command line directly). Snyk Code explains its highly accurate findings and provides help, including examples how to fix your Python security problems. And to top that, it’s easy to get started with and free to use on open source (plus a limited amount of non-OSS tests).
