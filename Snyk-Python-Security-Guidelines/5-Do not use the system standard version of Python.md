# Do not use the system standard version of Python

Most POSIX systems come preloaded with a version of Python. The problem with most built-in Python distributions is that they aren’t current. 

So, make sure to use the latest version of Python available for your system as well as the [official containers designed to run Python](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) and keep it updated. Snyk is here to help you. Scan your containers for necessary updates using [Snyk Container](https://snyk.io/product/container-vulnerability-management/) and check your dependencies using [Snyk Open Source](https://snyk.io/product/open-source-security-management/).
